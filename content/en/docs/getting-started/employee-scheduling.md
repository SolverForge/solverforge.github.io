## Introduction

### What You'll Learn

This guide walks you through a complete employee scheduling application built with **SolverForge**, a constraint-based optimization framework. You'll learn:

- How to model real-world scheduling problems as **optimization problems**
- How to express business rules as **constraints** that guide the solution
- How optimization algorithms find high-quality solutions automatically
- How to customize the system for your specific needs

**No optimization background required** — we'll explain concepts as we encounter them in the code.

> **Architecture Note:** This guide uses the "fast" implementation pattern with dataclass domain models and Pydantic only at API boundaries. For the architectural reasoning behind this design, see [Dataclasses vs Pydantic in Constraint Solvers](/blog/technical/python-constraint-solver-architecture/).

### Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge (classes, functions, type annotations)
- Familiarity with REST APIs
- Comfort with command-line operations

### What is Constraint-Based Optimization?

Traditional programming: You write explicit logic that says "do this, then that."

**Constraint-based optimization**: You describe what a good solution looks like and the solver figures out how to achieve it.

Think of it like describing what puzzle pieces you have and what rules they must follow — then having a computer try millions of arrangements per second to find the best fit.

## Getting Started

### Running the Application

1. **Download and navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SolverForge/solverforge-quickstarts
   cd ./solverforge-quickstarts/fast/employee-scheduling-fast
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python -m employee_scheduling.rest_api
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

You'll see a scheduling interface with employees, shifts and a "Solve" button. Click it and watch the solver automatically assign employees to shifts while respecting business rules.

## The Problem We're Solving

### The Scheduling Challenge

You need to assign **employees** to **shifts** while satisfying rules like:

**Hard constraints** (must be satisfied):
- Employee must have the required skill for the shift
- Employee can't work overlapping shifts
- Employee needs 10 hours rest between shifts
- Employee can't work more than one shift per day
- Employee can't work on days they're unavailable
- Employee can't work more than 12 shifts total

**Soft constraints** (preferences to optimize):
- Avoid scheduling on days the employee marked as "undesired"
- Prefer scheduling on days the employee marked as "desired"
- Balance workload fairly across all employees

### Why This is Hard

For even 20 shifts and 10 employees, there are **10^20 possible assignments** (100 quintillion). A human can't evaluate them all. Even a computer trying random assignments would take years.

**Optimization algorithms** use smart strategies to explore this space efficiently, finding high-quality solutions in seconds.

---

## Understanding the Data Model

Let's examine the three core classes that model our problem. Open `src/employee_scheduling/domain.py`:

### Domain Model Architecture

This quickstart separates domain models (dataclasses) from API models (Pydantic):

- **Domain layer** (`domain.py` lines 17-39): Pure `@dataclass` models for solver operations
- **API layer** (`domain.py` lines 46-75): Pydantic `BaseModel` classes for REST endpoints  
- **Converters** (`converters.py`): Translate between the two layers

*This separation provides better performance during solving—Pydantic's validation overhead becomes expensive when constraints are evaluated millions of times per second. See the [architecture article](/blog/technical/python-constraint-solver-architecture/) for benchmark comparisons. Note that while benchmarks on small problems show comparable iteration counts between Python and Java, the JPype bridge overhead may compound at larger scales.


### The Employee Class

```python
@dataclass
class Employee:
    name: Annotated[str, PlanningId]
    skills: set[str] = field(default_factory=set)
    unavailable_dates: set[date] = field(default_factory=set)
    undesired_dates: set[date] = field(default_factory=set)
    desired_dates: set[date] = field(default_factory=set)
```

**What it represents:** A person who can be assigned to shifts.

**Key fields:**
- `name`: Unique identifier (the `PlanningId` annotation tells SolverForge this is the primary key)
- `skills`: What skills this employee possesses (e.g., `{"Doctor", "Cardiology"}`)
- `unavailable_dates`: Days the employee absolutely cannot work (hard constraint)
- `undesired_dates`: Days the employee prefers not to work (soft constraint)
- `desired_dates`: Days the employee wants to work (soft constraint)

**Optimization concept:** These availability fields demonstrate **hard vs soft constraints**. Unavailable is non-negotiable; undesired is a preference the solver will try to honor but may violate if necessary.

### The Shift Class (Planning Entity)

```python
@planning_entity
@dataclass
class Shift:
    id: Annotated[str, PlanningId]
    start: datetime
    end: datetime
    location: str
    required_skill: str
    employee: Annotated[Employee | None, PlanningVariable] = None
```

**What it represents:** A time slot that needs an employee assignment.

**Key fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `start`/`end`: When the shift occurs
- `location`: Where the work happens
- `required_skill`: What skill is needed (must match employee's skills)
- **`employee`**: The assignment decision — this is what the solver optimizes!

**Important annotations:**
- `@planning_entity`: Tells SolverForge this class contains decisions to make
- `PlanningVariable`: Marks `employee` as the decision variable

**Optimization concept:** This is a **planning variable** — the value the solver assigns. Each shift starts with `employee=None` (unassigned). The solver tries different employee assignments, evaluating each according to your constraints.

### The EmployeeSchedule Class (Planning Solution)

```python
@planning_solution
@dataclass
class EmployeeSchedule:
    employees: Annotated[list[Employee], ProblemFactCollectionProperty, ValueRangeProvider]
    shifts: Annotated[list[Shift], PlanningEntityCollectionProperty]
    score: Annotated[HardSoftDecimalScore | None, PlanningScore] = None
    solver_status: SolverStatus = SolverStatus.NOT_SOLVING
```

**What it represents:** The complete problem and its solution.

**Key fields:**
- `employees`: All available employees (these are the possible values for assignments)
- `shifts`: All shifts that need assignment (the planning entities)
- `score`: Solution quality metric (calculated by constraints)
- `solver_status`: Whether solving is active

**Annotations explained:**
- `@planning_solution`: Marks this as the top-level problem definition
- `ProblemFactCollectionProperty`: Immutable data (doesn't change during solving)
- `PlanningEntityCollectionProperty`: The entities being optimized
- `ValueRangeProvider`: Tells the solver which employees can be assigned to shifts
- `PlanningScore`: Where the solver stores the calculated score

**Optimization concept:** This demonstrates the **declarative modeling approach**. You describe the problem structure (what can be assigned to what) and the solver handles the search process.

---

## How Optimization Works

Before diving into constraints, let's understand how the solver finds solutions.

### The Search Process (Simplified)

1. **Start with an initial solution** (often random or all unassigned)
2. **Evaluate the score** using your constraint functions
3. **Make a small change** (assign a different employee to one shift)
4. **Evaluate the new score**
5. **Keep the change if it improves the score** (with some controlled randomness)
6. **Repeat millions of times** in seconds
7. **Return the best solution found**

### Why This Works: Metaheuristics

[Timefold](http://timefold.ai) (the engine that powers SolverForge) uses sophisticated **metaheuristic algorithms** like:

- **Tabu Search**: Remembers recent moves to avoid cycling
- **Simulated Annealing**: Occasionally accepts worse solutions to escape local optima
- **Late Acceptance**: Compares current solution to recent history, not just the immediate previous

These techniques efficiently explore the massive solution space without getting stuck.

### The Score: How "Good" is a Solution?

Every solution gets a score with two parts:

```
0hard/-45soft
```

- **Hard score**: Counts hard constraint violations (must be 0 for a valid solution)
- **Soft score**: Counts soft constraint violations/rewards (higher is better)

**Scoring rules:**
- Hard score must be 0 or positive (negative = invalid/infeasible)
- Among valid solutions (hard score = 0), highest soft score wins
- Hard score always takes priority over soft score

**Optimization concept:** This is **multi-objective optimization** with a **lexicographic ordering**. We absolutely prioritize hard constraints, then optimize soft ones.

---

## Writing Constraints: The Business Rules

Now the heart of the system. Open `src/employee_scheduling/constraints.py`.

### The Constraint Provider Pattern

All constraints are registered in one function:

```python
@constraint_provider
def define_constraints(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    return [
        # Hard constraints
        required_skill(constraint_factory),
        no_overlapping_shifts(constraint_factory),
        at_least_10_hours_between_two_shifts(constraint_factory),
        one_shift_per_day(constraint_factory),
        unavailable_employee(constraint_factory),
        max_shifts_per_employee(constraint_factory),
        # Soft constraints
        undesired_day_for_employee(constraint_factory),
        desired_day_for_employee(constraint_factory),
        balance_employee_shift_assignments(constraint_factory),
    ]
```

Each constraint is a function returning a `Constraint` object. Let's examine them from simple to complex.

### Domain Model Methods for Constraints

The `Shift` class in `domain.py` includes helper methods that support datetime calculations used by multiple constraints. Following object-oriented design principles, these methods are part of the domain model rather than standalone functions:

```python
def has_required_skill(self) -> bool:
    """Check if assigned employee has the required skill."""
    if self.employee is None:
        return False
    return self.required_skill in self.employee.skills

def is_overlapping_with_date(self, dt: date) -> bool:
    """Check if shift overlaps with a specific date."""
    return self.start.date() == dt or self.end.date() == dt

def get_overlapping_duration_in_minutes(self, dt: date) -> int:
    """Calculate how many minutes of a shift fall on a specific date."""
    start_date_time = datetime.combine(dt, datetime.min.time())
    end_date_time = datetime.combine(dt, datetime.max.time())

    # Calculate overlap between date range and shift range
    max_start_time = max(start_date_time, self.start)
    min_end_time = min(end_date_time, self.end)

    minutes = (min_end_time - max_start_time).total_seconds() / 60
    return int(max(0, minutes))
```

These methods encapsulate shift-related logic within the domain model, making constraints more readable and maintainable. They're particularly important for date-boundary calculations (e.g., a shift spanning midnight).

### Hard Constraint: Required Skill

**Business rule:** "An employee assigned to a shift must have the required skill."

```python
def required_skill(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    return (
        constraint_factory.for_each(Shift)
        .filter(lambda shift: not shift.has_required_skill())
        .penalize(HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_HARD)
        .as_constraint("Missing required skill")
    )
```

**How to read this:**
1. `for_each(Shift)`: Consider every shift in the schedule
2. `.filter(...)`: Keep only shifts where the employee lacks the required skill
3. `.penalize(ONE_HARD)`: Each violation subtracts 1 from the hard score
4. `.as_constraint(...)`: Give it a name for debugging

**Optimization concept:** This is a **unary constraint** — it examines one entity at a time. The filter identifies violations and the penalty quantifies the impact.

**Note:** There's no null check for `shift.employee` because constraints are only evaluated on complete assignments during the scoring phase.

### Hard Constraint: No Overlapping Shifts

**Business rule:** "An employee can't work two shifts that overlap in time."

```python
def no_overlapping_shifts(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    return (
        constraint_factory.for_each_unique_pair(
            Shift,
            Joiners.equal(lambda shift: shift.employee.name),
            Joiners.overlapping(lambda shift: shift.start, lambda shift: shift.end),
        )
        .penalize(HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_HARD, get_minute_overlap)
        .as_constraint("Overlapping shift")
    )
```

**How to read this:**
1. `for_each_unique_pair(Shift, ...)`: Create pairs of shifts
2. `Joiners.equal(lambda shift: shift.employee.name)`: Only pair shifts assigned to the same employee
3. `Joiners.overlapping(...)`: Only pair shifts that overlap in time
4. `.penalize(ONE_HARD, get_minute_overlap)`: Penalize by the number of overlapping minutes

**Optimization concept:** This is a **binary constraint** — it examines pairs of entities. The `for_each_unique_pair` ensures we don't count each violation twice (e.g., comparing shift A to B and B to A).

**Helper function:**
```python
def get_minute_overlap(shift1: Shift, shift2: Shift) -> int:
    return (
        min(shift1.end, shift2.end) - max(shift1.start, shift2.start)
    ).total_seconds() // 60
```

**Why penalize by minutes?** This creates a **graded penalty**. A 5-minute overlap is less bad than a 5-hour overlap, giving the solver better guidance.

### Hard Constraint: Rest Between Shifts

**Business rule:** "Employees need at least 10 hours rest between shifts."

```python
def at_least_10_hours_between_two_shifts(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    return (
        constraint_factory.for_each(Shift)
        .join(
            Shift,
            Joiners.equal(lambda shift: shift.employee.name),
            Joiners.less_than_or_equal(
                lambda shift: shift.end, lambda shift: shift.start
            ),
        )
        .filter(
            lambda first_shift, second_shift: (
                second_shift.start - first_shift.end
            ).total_seconds() // (60 * 60) < 10
        )
        .penalize(
            HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_HARD,
            lambda first_shift, second_shift: 600 - (
                (second_shift.start - first_shift.end).total_seconds() // 60
            ),
        )
        .as_constraint("At least 10 hours between 2 shifts")
    )
```

**How to read this:**
1. `for_each(Shift)`: Start with all shifts
2. `.join(Shift, ...)`: Pair with other shifts
3. `Joiners.equal(...)`: Same employee
4. `Joiners.less_than_or_equal(...)`: First shift ends before or when second starts (ensures ordering)
5. `.filter(...)`: Keep only pairs with less than 10 hours gap
6. `.penalize(...)`: Penalize by `600 - actual_minutes` (the deficit from required 10 hours)

**Optimization concept:** The penalty function `600 - actual_minutes` creates **incremental guidance**. 9 hours rest (penalty 60) is better than 5 hours rest (penalty 300), helping the solver navigate toward feasibility.

### Hard Constraint: One Shift Per Day

**Business rule:** "Employees can work at most one shift per calendar day."

```python
def one_shift_per_day(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    return (
        constraint_factory.for_each_unique_pair(
            Shift,
            Joiners.equal(lambda shift: shift.employee.name),
            Joiners.equal(lambda shift: shift.start.date()),
        )
        .penalize(HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_HARD)
        .as_constraint("Max one shift per day")
    )
```

**How to read this:**
1. `for_each_unique_pair(Shift, ...)`: Create pairs of shifts
2. First joiner: Same employee
3. Second joiner: Same date (`shift.start.date()` extracts calendar day)
4. Each pair found is a violation

### Hard Constraint: Unavailable Dates

**Business rule:** "Employees cannot work on days they marked as unavailable."

```python
def unavailable_employee(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    return (
        constraint_factory.for_each(Shift)
        .join(
            Employee,
            Joiners.equal(lambda shift: shift.employee, lambda employee: employee),
        )
        .flatten_last(lambda employee: employee.unavailable_dates)
        .filter(lambda shift, unavailable_date: shift.is_overlapping_with_date(unavailable_date))
        .penalize(
            HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_HARD,
            lambda shift, unavailable_date: shift.get_overlapping_duration_in_minutes(unavailable_date),
        )
        .as_constraint("Unavailable employee")
    )
```

**How to read this:**
1. `for_each(Shift)`: All shifts
2. `.join(Employee, ...)`: Join with the assigned employee
3. `.flatten_last(lambda employee: employee.unavailable_dates)`: Expand each employee's unavailable_dates set
4. `.filter(...)`: Keep only when shift overlaps the unavailable date
5. `.penalize(...)`: Penalize by overlapping duration in minutes

**Optimization concept:** The `flatten_last` operation demonstrates **constraint streaming with collections**. We iterate over each date in the employee's unavailable set, creating (shift, date) pairs to check. The `shift.is_overlapping_with_date()` and `shift.get_overlapping_duration_in_minutes()` methods are defined on the Shift domain model class.

### Soft Constraint: Undesired Days

**Business rule:** "Prefer not to schedule employees on days they marked as undesired."

```python
def undesired_day_for_employee(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    return (
        constraint_factory.for_each(Shift)
        .join(
            Employee,
            Joiners.equal(lambda shift: shift.employee, lambda employee: employee),
        )
        .flatten_last(lambda employee: employee.undesired_dates)
        .filter(lambda shift, undesired_date: shift.is_overlapping_with_date(undesired_date))
        .penalize(
            HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_SOFT,
            lambda shift, undesired_date: shift.get_overlapping_duration_in_minutes(undesired_date),
        )
        .as_constraint("Undesired day for employee")
    )
```

**Key difference from hard constraints:** Uses `ONE_SOFT` instead of `ONE_HARD`.

**Optimization concept:** The solver will try to avoid undesired days but may violate this if necessary to satisfy hard constraints or achieve better overall soft score.

### Soft Constraint: Desired Days (Reward)

**Business rule:** "Prefer to schedule employees on days they marked as desired."

```python
def desired_day_for_employee(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    return (
        constraint_factory.for_each(Shift)
        .join(
            Employee,
            Joiners.equal(lambda shift: shift.employee, lambda employee: employee),
        )
        .flatten_last(lambda employee: employee.desired_dates)
        .filter(lambda shift, desired_date: shift.is_overlapping_with_date(desired_date))
        .reward(
            HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_SOFT,
            lambda shift, desired_date: shift.get_overlapping_duration_in_minutes(desired_date),
        )
        .as_constraint("Desired day for employee")
    )
```

**Key difference:** Uses `.reward()` instead of `.penalize()`.

**Optimization concept:** Rewards **increase** the score instead of decreasing it. This constraint actively pulls the solution toward desired assignments.

### Soft Constraint: Load Balancing

**Business rule:** "Distribute shifts fairly across employees."

```python
def balance_employee_shift_assignments(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    return (
        constraint_factory.for_each(Shift)
        .group_by(lambda shift: shift.employee, ConstraintCollectors.count())
        .complement(Employee, lambda e: 0)
        .group_by(
            ConstraintCollectors.load_balance(
                lambda employee, shift_count: employee,
                lambda employee, shift_count: shift_count,
            )
        )
        .penalize_decimal(
            HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_SOFT,
            lambda load_balance: load_balance.unfairness(),
        )
        .as_constraint("Balance employee shift assignments")
    )
```

**How to read this:**
1. `for_each(Shift)`: All shifts
2. `.group_by(..., ConstraintCollectors.count())`: Count shifts per employee
3. `.complement(Employee, lambda e: 0)`: Include employees with 0 shifts
4. `.group_by(ConstraintCollectors.load_balance(...))`: Calculate fairness metric
5. `.penalize_decimal(..., unfairness())`: Penalize by the unfairness amount

**Optimization concept:** This uses a sophisticated **load balancing collector** that calculates variance/unfairness in workload distribution. It's more nuanced than simple quadratic penalties — it measures how far the distribution is from perfectly balanced.

**Why complement?** Without it, employees with zero shifts wouldn't appear in the grouping, skewing the fairness calculation.

## The Solver Engine

Now let's see how the solver is configured. Open `src/employee_scheduling/solver.py`:

```python
solver_config = SolverConfig(
    solution_class=EmployeeSchedule,
    entity_class_list=[Shift],
    score_director_factory_config=ScoreDirectorFactoryConfig(
        constraint_provider_function=define_constraints
    ),
    termination_config=TerminationConfig(spent_limit=Duration(seconds=30)),
)

solver_manager = SolverManager.create(SolverFactory.create(solver_config))
solution_manager = SolutionManager.create(solver_manager)
```

### Configuration Breakdown

**`solution_class`**: Your planning solution class (`EmployeeSchedule`)

**`entity_class_list`**: Planning entities to optimize (`[Shift]`)

**`score_director_factory_config`**: Contains the constraint provider function
- **Note:** This is nested inside `ScoreDirectorFactoryConfig`, not directly in `SolverConfig`

**`termination_config`**: When to stop solving
- `spent_limit=Duration(seconds=30)`: Stop after 30 seconds

### SolverManager: Asynchronous Solving

`SolverManager` handles solving in the background without blocking your API:

```python
# Start solving (non-blocking)
solver_manager.solve_and_listen(job_id, schedule, callback_function)

# Check status
status = solver_manager.get_status(job_id)

# Get current best solution
solution = solver_manager.get_solution(job_id)

# Stop early
solver_manager.terminate_early(job_id)
```

**Optimization concept:** Real-world problems may take minutes to hours. **Anytime algorithms** like metaheuristics continuously improve solutions over time, so you can stop whenever you're satisfied with the quality.

### Solving Timeline

**Small problems** (10-20 shifts, 5-10 employees):
- Initial valid solution: < 1 second
- Good solution: 5-10 seconds
- High-quality: 30 seconds

**Medium problems** (50-100 shifts, 20-30 employees):
- Initial valid solution: 1-5 seconds
- Good solution: 30-60 seconds
- High-quality: 5-10 minutes

**Factors affecting speed:**
- Number of employees × shifts (search space size)
- Constraint complexity
- How "tight" constraints are (fewer valid solutions = harder)

    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** Field names use camelCase in JSON (REST API convention) but snake_case in Python (domain model). The `converters.py` handles this translation.

#### POST /schedules

Submit a schedule to solve:

**Request body:** Same format as demo-data response

**Response:** Job ID as plain text
```
"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"
```

**Implementation:**
```python
@app.post("/schedules")
async def solve_timetable(schedule_model: EmployeeScheduleModel) -> str:
    job_id = str(uuid4())
    schedule = model_to_schedule(schedule_model)
    data_sets[job_id] = schedule
    solver_manager.solve_and_listen(
        job_id, 
        schedule,
        lambda solution: update_schedule(job_id, solution)
    )
    return job_id
```

**Key detail:** Uses `solve_and_listen()` with a callback that updates the stored solution in real-time as solving progresses.

#### GET /schedules/{problem_id}

Check solving status and get current solution:

**Response (while solving):**
```json
{
  "employees": [...],
  "shifts": [...],
  "score": "0hard/-45soft",
  "solverStatus": "SOLVING_ACTIVE"
}
```

**Response (finished):**
```json
{
  "employees": [...],
  "shifts": [...],
  "score": "0hard/-12soft",
  "solverStatus": "NOT_SOLVING"
}
```

#### DELETE /schedules/{problem_id}

Stop solving early and return best solution found so far:

```python
@app.delete("/schedules/{problem_id}")
async def stop_solving(problem_id: str) -> None:
    solver_manager.terminate_early(problem_id)
```

### Web UI Flow

The `static/app.js` implements this polling workflow:

1. **User opens page** → Load demo data (`GET /demo-data/SMALL`)
2. **Display** employees and shifts in timeline visualization
3. **User clicks "Solve"** → `POST /schedules` (get job ID back)
4. **Poll** `GET /schedules/{id}` every 2 seconds
5. **Update UI** with latest assignments in real-time
6. **When** `solverStatus === "NOT_SOLVING"` → Stop polling
7. **Display** final score and solution

**Visual feedback:** The UI uses vis-timeline library to show:
- Shifts color-coded by availability (red=unavailable, orange=undesired, green=desired, blue=normal)
- Skills color-coded (red=missing skill, green=has skill)
- Two views: by employee and by location

---

## Making Your First Customization

The quickstart includes a cardinality constraint that demonstrates a common pattern. Let's understand how it works and then learn how to create similar constraints.

### Understanding the Max Shifts Constraint

The codebase includes `max_shifts_per_employee` which limits workload imbalance:

**Business rule:** "No employee can work more than 12 shifts in the schedule period."

This is a **hard constraint** (must be satisfied).

### The Constraint Implementation

This constraint is already in `src/employee_scheduling/constraints.py`:

```python
def max_shifts_per_employee(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    """
    Hard constraint: No employee can have more than 12 shifts.

    The limit of 12 is chosen based on the demo data dimensions:
    - SMALL dataset: 139 shifts / 15 employees = ~9.3 average
    - This provides headroom while preventing extreme imbalance

    Note: A limit that's too low (e.g., 5) would make the problem infeasible.
    Always ensure your constraints are compatible with your data dimensions.
    """
    return (
        constraint_factory.for_each(Shift)
        .group_by(lambda shift: shift.employee, ConstraintCollectors.count())
        .filter(lambda employee, shift_count: shift_count > 12)
        .penalize(
            HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_HARD,
            lambda employee, shift_count: shift_count - 12,
        )
        .as_constraint("Max 12 shifts per employee")
    )
```

**How this works:**
1. Group shifts by employee and count them
2. Filter to employees with more than 12 shifts
3. Penalize by the excess amount (13 shifts = penalty 1, 14 shifts = penalty 2, etc.)

**Why 12?** The demo data has 139 shifts and 15 employees (~9.3 shifts per employee on average). A limit that's too low (e.g., 5) would make the problem **infeasible** — there simply aren't enough employees to cover all shifts. Always ensure your constraints are compatible with your problem's dimensions.

### How It's Registered

The constraint is registered in `define_constraints()` along with the other constraints:

```python
@constraint_provider
def define_constraints(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    return [
        # Hard constraints
        required_skill(constraint_factory),
        no_overlapping_shifts(constraint_factory),
        at_least_10_hours_between_two_shifts(constraint_factory),
        one_shift_per_day(constraint_factory),
        unavailable_employee(constraint_factory),
        max_shifts_per_employee(constraint_factory),  # ← Cardinality constraint
        # Soft constraints
        undesired_day_for_employee(constraint_factory),
        desired_day_for_employee(constraint_factory),
        balance_employee_shift_assignments(constraint_factory),
    ]
```

### Experimenting With It

Try modifying the constraint to see its effect:

1. Change the limit from 12 to 8 in `constraints.py`
2. Restart the server: `python -m employee_scheduling.rest_api`
3. Load demo data and click "Solve"
4. Observe how the constraint affects the solution

**Note:** A very low limit (e.g., 5) will make the problem infeasible.

### Why Unit Testing Constraints Matters

The quickstart includes unit tests in `tests/test_constraints.py` using `ConstraintVerifier`. Run them with:

```bash
pytest tests/test_constraints.py -v
```

Testing catches critical issues early. When we initially implemented this constraint with a limit of 5, the feasibility test (`test_feasible.py`) failed — the solver couldn't find a valid solution because there weren't enough employees to cover all shifts within that limit. Without tests, this would have silently broken the scheduling system. **Always test new constraints** — a typo in a filter or an overly restrictive limit can make your problem unsolvable.

### Understanding What You Did

You just implemented a **cardinality constraint** — limiting the count of something. This pattern is extremely common in scheduling:

- Maximum hours per week
- Minimum shifts per employee
- Exact number of nurses per shift

The pattern is always:
1. Group by what you're counting
2. Collect the count
3. Filter by your limit
4. Penalize/reward appropriately

---

## Advanced Constraint Patterns

### Pattern 1: Weighted Penalties

**Scenario:** Some skills are harder to staff — penalize their absence more heavily.

```python
def preferred_skill_coverage(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    """
    Soft constraint: Prefer specialized skills when available.
    """
    SPECIALTY_SKILLS = {"Cardiology", "Anaesthetics", "Radiology"}
    
    return (
        constraint_factory.for_each(Shift)
        .filter(lambda shift: shift.required_skill in SPECIALTY_SKILLS)
        .filter(lambda shift: shift.required_skill in shift.employee.skills)
        .reward(
            HardSoftDecimalScore.of_soft(10),  # 10x normal reward
        )
        .as_constraint("Preferred specialty coverage")
    )
```

**Optimization concept:** **Weighted constraints** let you express relative importance. This rewards specialty matches 10 times more than standard matches.

### Pattern 2: Conditional Constraints

**Scenario:** Night shifts (after 6 PM) require two employees at the same location.

```python
def night_shift_minimum_staff(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    """
    Hard constraint: Night shifts need at least 2 employees per location.
    """
    def is_night_shift(shift: Shift) -> bool:
        return shift.start.hour >= 18  # 6 PM or later
    
    return (
        constraint_factory.for_each(Shift)
        .filter(is_night_shift)
        .group_by(
            lambda shift: (shift.start, shift.location),
            ConstraintCollectors.count()
        )
        .filter(lambda timeslot_location, count: count < 2)
        .penalize(
            HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_HARD,
            lambda timeslot_location, count: 2 - count
        )
        .as_constraint("Night shift minimum 2 staff")
    )
```

### Pattern 3: Employee Pairing (Incompatibility)

**Scenario:** Certain employees shouldn't work the same shift.

First, add the field to `domain.py`:

```python
@dataclass
class Employee:
    name: Annotated[str, PlanningId]
    skills: set[str] = field(default_factory=set)
    # ... existing fields ...
    incompatible_with: set[str] = field(default_factory=set)  # employee names
```

Then the constraint:

```python
def avoid_incompatible_pairs(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    """
    Hard constraint: Incompatible employees can't work overlapping shifts.
    """
    return (
        constraint_factory.for_each(Shift)
        .join(
            Shift,
            Joiners.equal(lambda shift: shift.location),
            Joiners.overlapping(lambda shift: shift.start, lambda shift: shift.end),
        )
        .filter(
            lambda shift1, shift2: 
                shift2.employee.name in shift1.employee.incompatible_with
        )
        .penalize(HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_HARD)
        .as_constraint("Avoid incompatible pairs")
    )
```

### Pattern 4: Time-Based Accumulation

**Scenario:** Limit total hours worked per week.

```python
def max_hours_per_week(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    """
    Hard constraint: Maximum 40 hours per employee per week.
    """
    def get_shift_hours(shift: Shift) -> float:
        return (shift.end - shift.start).total_seconds() / 3600
    
    def get_week(shift: Shift) -> int:
        return shift.start.isocalendar()[1]  # ISO week number
    
    return (
        constraint_factory.for_each(Shift)
        .group_by(
            lambda shift: (shift.employee, get_week(shift)),
            ConstraintCollectors.sum(get_shift_hours)
        )
        .filter(lambda employee_week, total_hours: total_hours > 40)
        .penalize(
            HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_HARD,
            lambda employee_week, total_hours: int(total_hours - 40)
        )
        .as_constraint("Max 40 hours per week")
    )
```

**Optimization concept:** This uses **temporal aggregation** — grouping by time periods (weeks) and summing durations. Common in workforce scheduling.

## Testing and Validation

### Unit Testing Constraints

Best practice: Test each constraint in isolation.

Create `tests/test_my_constraints.py`:

```python
from datetime import datetime, date
from employee_scheduling.domain import Employee, Shift, EmployeeSchedule
from employee_scheduling.solver import solver_config
from solverforge_legacy.solver import SolverFactory

def test_max_shifts_constraint_violation():
    """Test that exceeding 5 shifts creates a hard constraint violation."""
    
    employee = Employee(
        name="Test Employee",
        skills={"Doctor"}
    )
    
    # Create 6 shifts assigned to same employee
    shifts = []
    for i in range(6):
        shifts.append(Shift(
            id=str(i),
            start=datetime(2025, 11, 25 + i, 9, 0),
            end=datetime(2025, 11, 25 + i, 17, 0),
            location="Test Location",
            required_skill="Doctor",
            employee=employee
        ))
    
    schedule = EmployeeSchedule(
        employees=[employee],
        shifts=shifts
    )
    
    # Score the solution
    solver_factory = SolverFactory.create(solver_config)
    score_director = solver_factory.get_score_director_factory().build_score_director()
    score_director.set_working_solution(schedule)
    score = score_director.calculate_score()
    
    # Verify hard constraint violation
    assert score.hard_score == -1, f"Expected -1 hard score, got {score.hard_score}"
    
def test_max_shifts_constraint_satisfied():
    """Test that 5 or fewer shifts doesn't violate constraint."""
    
    employee = Employee(
        name="Test Employee",
        skills={"Doctor"}
    )
    
    # Create only 5 shifts
    shifts = []
    for i in range(5):
        shifts.append(Shift(
            id=str(i),
            start=datetime(2025, 11, 25 + i, 9, 0),
            end=datetime(2025, 11, 25 + i, 17, 0),
            location="Test Location",
            required_skill="Doctor",
            employee=employee
        ))
    
    schedule = EmployeeSchedule(
        employees=[employee],
        shifts=shifts
    )
    
    solver_factory = SolverFactory.create(solver_config)
    score_director = solver_factory.get_score_director_factory().build_score_director()
    score_director.set_working_solution(schedule)
    score = score_director.calculate_score()
    
    # No violation from this constraint (may have soft penalties from balancing, etc.)
    assert score.hard_score >= -0, f"Expected non-negative hard score, got {score.hard_score}"
```

Run with:
```bash
pytest tests/test_my_constraints.py -v
```

### Integration Testing: Full Solve

Test the complete solving cycle in `tests/test_feasible.py`:

```python
import time
from employee_scheduling.demo_data import DemoData, generate_demo_data
from employee_scheduling.solver import solver_manager
from solverforge_legacy.solver import SolverStatus

def test_solve_small_dataset():
    """Test that solver finds a feasible solution for small dataset."""
    
    # Generate problem
    schedule = generate_demo_data(DemoData.SMALL)
    
    # Verify initially unassigned
    assert all(shift.employee is None for shift in schedule.shifts)
    
    # Solve
    job_id = "test-job"
    solver_manager.solve(job_id, schedule)
    
    # Wait for completion (with timeout)
    timeout_seconds = 60
    start_time = time.time()
    while solver_manager.get_solver_status(job_id) != SolverStatus.NOT_SOLVING:
        if time.time() - start_time > timeout_seconds:
            solver_manager.terminate_early(job_id)
            break
        time.sleep(1)
    
    # Get solution
    solution = solver_manager.get_solution(job_id)
    
    # Verify all shifts assigned
    assert all(shift.employee is not None for shift in solution.shifts), \
        "Not all shifts were assigned"
    
    # Verify feasible (hard score = 0)
    assert solution.score.hard_score == 0, \
        f"Solution is infeasible with hard score {solution.score.hard_score}"
    
    print(f"Final score: {solution.score}")
```

### Manual Testing via UI

1. Start the application: `python -m employee_scheduling.rest_api`
2. Open browser console (F12) to see API calls
3. Load "SMALL" demo data
4. Verify data displays correctly (employees with skills, shifts unassigned)
5. Click "Solve" and watch:
   - Score improving in real-time
   - Shifts getting assigned (colored by availability)
   - Final hard score reaches 0
6. Manually verify constraint satisfaction:
   - Check that assigned employees have required skills (green badges)
   - Verify no overlapping shifts (timeline shouldn't show overlaps)
   - Confirm unavailable days are respected (no shifts on red-highlighted dates)

### Common Constraint Patterns

**Unary constraint (examine one entity):**
```python
constraint_factory.for_each(Shift)
    .filter(lambda shift: # condition)
    .penalize(HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_HARD)
```

**Binary constraint (examine pairs):**
```python
constraint_factory.for_each_unique_pair(
    Shift,
    Joiners.equal(lambda shift: shift.employee.name)
)
    .penalize(HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_HARD)
```

**Grouping and counting:**
```python
constraint_factory.for_each(Shift)
    .group_by(
        lambda shift: shift.employee,
        ConstraintCollectors.count()
    )
    .filter(lambda employee, count: count > MAX)
    .penalize(...)
```

**Reward instead of penalize:**
```python
.reward(HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_SOFT)
```

**Variable penalty:**
```python
.penalize(
    HardSoftDecimalScore.ONE_HARD,
    lambda shift: calculate_penalty_amount(shift)
)
```

**Working with collections (flatten):**
```python
constraint_factory.for_each(Shift)
    .join(Employee, Joiners.equal(...))
    .flatten_last(lambda employee: employee.unavailable_dates)
    .filter(...)
```

### Common Joiners

| Joiner | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Joiners.equal(lambda x: x.field)` | Match entities with same field value |
| `Joiners.less_than(lambda x: x.field)` | First entity's field < second's (ensures ordering) |
| `Joiners.overlapping(start, end)` | Time intervals overlap |

### Debugging Tips

**Enable verbose logging:**
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

**Test constraint in isolation:**
```python
# Create minimal test case with just the constraint you're debugging
schedule = EmployeeSchedule(
    employees=[test_employee],
    shifts=[test_shift]
)

solver_factory = SolverFactory.create(solver_config)
score_director = solver_factory.get_score_director_factory().build_score_director()
score_director.set_working_solution(schedule)
score = score_director.calculate_score()

print(f"Score: {score}")
```

**Check constraint matches:**
Add print statements (remove in production):
```python
.filter(lambda shift: (
    print(f"Checking shift {shift.id}") or  # Debug print
    shift.required_skill not in shift.employee.skills
))
```

### Common Gotchas

1. **Forgot to register constraint** in `define_constraints()` return list
   - Symptom: Constraint not enforced

2. **Using wrong Joiner**
   - `Joiners.equal` when you need `Joiners.less_than`
   - Symptom: Pairs counted twice or constraint not working

3. **Expensive operations in constraint functions**
   - Database/API calls in filters
   - Symptom: Solving extremely slow

4. **Score sign confusion**
   - Higher soft score is better (not worse!)
   - Hard score must be ≥ 0 for feasible solution

5. **Field name mismatch**
   - Guide said `skill_set`, actual is `skills`
   - Guide said `employee_list`, actual is `employees`
