# What is SolverForge?

SolverForge is a **constraint satisfaction solver** for real-world planning and
scheduling problems. It helps you assign resources to tasks while respecting
business rules and optimizing for your goals.

## What Problems Does It Solve?

SolverForge excels at **combinatorial planning problems** — problems where a
brute-force search is impossible (millions to billions of possibilities), but a
good solution dramatically improves efficiency.

shifts based on skills, availability, and labor regulations. {{< /card >}}

travel time while meeting time windows. {{< /card >}}

## How Is This Different from Gurobi or CVXPY?

This is a common question. **SolverForge and mathematical programming solvers
(Gurobi, CPLEX, OR-Tools, CVXPY) solve different kinds of problems using
different approaches.**

|                          | SolverForge                                | Mathematical Solvers (Gurobi, CVXPY)                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Problem type**         | Constraint satisfaction & scheduling       | Linear/mixed-integer programming                          |
| **Modeling approach**    | Business objects with rules                | Mathematical equations & matrices                         |
| **Constraints**          | Natural language-like rules on objects     | Linear inequalities (Ax ≤ b)                              |
| **Best for**             | Scheduling, routing, assignment            | Resource allocation, network flow, portfolio optimization |
| **Developer experience** | Write rules about "Shifts" and "Employees" | Formulate objective functions and constraint matrices     |

### A Concrete Example

{{< tabpane text=true >}} {{% tab header="SolverForge (Rust)" %}}

```rust
use solverforge::prelude::*;
use solverforge::stream::{joiner::*, ConstraintFactory};

fn define_constraints() -> impl ConstraintSet<Schedule, HardSoftScore> {
    use ScheduleConstraintStreams;
    use ShiftUnassignedFilter;

    let factory = ConstraintFactory::<Schedule, HardSoftScore>::new();

    let unassigned = factory.clone()
        .shifts()
        .unassigned()
        .penalize_hard()
        .named("Unassigned shift");

    let missing_skill = factory
        .shifts()
        .filter(|shift: &Shift| shift.employee_id.is_some())
        .join((
            |s: &Schedule| &s.employees,
            equal_bi(
                |shift: &Shift| shift.employee_id,
                |emp: &Employee| Some(emp.id),
            ),
        ))
        .filter(|shift: &Shift, emp: &Employee| {
            !emp.skills.contains(&shift.required_skill)
        })
        .penalize_hard()
        .named("Missing skill");

    (unassigned, missing_skill)
}
```

{{% /tab %}} {{% tab header="Gurobi/CVXPY" %}}

```python
# You must translate your problem into mathematical form
x = model.addVars(employees, shifts, vtype=GRB.BINARY)
model.addConstrs(sum(x[e,s] for e in employees) == 1 for s in shifts)
model.addConstrs(sum(x[e,s] for s in shifts) <= max_shifts for e in employees)
```

{{% /tab %}} {{< /tabpane >}}

**The key difference:** With SolverForge, you work with domain objects (`Shift`,
`Employee`) and express constraints as natural business rules. You don't need to
reformulate your problem as a system of linear equations.

### When to Use Each

**Use SolverForge when:**

- Your problem involves scheduling, routing, or assignment
- Constraints are naturally expressed as business rules
- The problem structure doesn't fit neatly into linear programming
- You want readable, maintainable constraint definitions

**Use Gurobi/CVXPY when:**

- Your problem is naturally linear or convex
- You need provably optimal solutions with bounds
- The problem fits the mathematical programming paradigm (LP, MIP, QP)

## The Developer Experience

SolverForge provides a **Rust derive-macro API** for ergonomic domain modeling:

```rust
use solverforge::prelude::*;

#[planning_entity]
pub struct Shift {
    #[planning_id]
    pub id: usize,
    pub required_skill: String,
    #[planning_variable(value_range = "employees", allows_unassigned = true)]
    pub employee_id: Option<usize>,
}

#[planning_solution(constraints = "crate::constraints::define_constraints")]
pub struct Schedule {
    #[problem_fact_collection]
    pub employees: Vec<Employee>,
    #[planning_entity_collection]
    pub shifts: Vec<Shift>,
    #[planning_score]
    pub score: Option<HardSoftScore>,
}
```

You define your domain model with derive macros and attribute annotations. The
solver figures out how to assign employees to shifts while respecting your
constraints.

# Project Status & Roadmap

{{% pageinfo %}} SolverForge is a **production-ready constraint solver** written
in Rust. This documentation set is aligned with **SolverForge 0.8.10** and the
current crate line targets **Rust 1.92+**. {{% /pageinfo %}}

## Current Status

| Component     | Status              | Description                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |

**Want to try it today?**

- Follow [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) for the CLI-first onboarding
  path and the full employee scheduling tutorial

## What's Complete

SolverForge Rust is **feature-complete** as a production constraint solver:

- **Constraint Streams API**: Declarative constraint definition with `for_each`,
  generated collection accessors, `filter`, unified `join(...)`,
  `flatten_last`, `group_by`, `balance`, `if_exists(...)`,
  `if_not_exists(...)`, `penalize`, `reward`, and `.named(...)`
- **Score Types**: SoftScore, HardSoftScore, HardMediumSoftScore,
  HardSoftDecimalScore, BendableScore
- **Score Analysis**: `ScoreAnalysis`, `ConstraintAnalysis`, `ScoreExplanation`,
  `IndictmentMap`
- **SERIO Engine**: Scoring Engine for Real-time Incremental Optimization
- **Solver Phases**:
  - Construction Heuristics for standard and list-variable models
  - Local Search with Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Late
    Acceptance, and Great Deluge in the stock config surface
  - Exhaustive Search (`branch_and_bound`, `brute_force`)
  - Partitioned Search (multi-threaded)
  - VND (Variable Neighborhood Descent)
- **Move System**: Zero-allocation typed moves with arena allocation — Change,
  Swap, Composite, ListChange, ListSwap, ListReverse, SubListChange,
  SubListSwap, KOpt, ListRuin, Ruin, PillarChange, PillarSwap
- **List Variables**: Full support for sequencing/routing problems
- **Nearby Selection**: Distance-based move selection for large problems
- **Balance stream**: Load-balancing constraint support without manual grouped
  unfairness scoring
- **SolverManager API**: Retained job lifecycle with
  `SolverEvent::{Progress, BestSolution, PauseRequested, Paused, Resumed, Completed, Cancelled, Failed}`,
  `SolverStatus`, exact in-process pause/resume checkpoints, retained
  snapshots, snapshot-bound analysis, terminal-job deletion, and exact retained
  telemetry
- **Configuration**: stock `solver.toml` loading plus
  `SolverConfig::load()`, `from_toml_str()`, `from_yaml_str()`, and
  `#[planning_solution(config = "...")]` overlays that decorate the loaded
  runtime config

## Runtime Notes for 0.8.10

- **Canonical shadow lifecycle**: `PlanningSolution` now owns
  `update_all_shadows()` and `update_entity_shadows(...)`, and the stock
  `ScoreDirector` calls those hooks directly during initialization and after
  variable changes. Shadow updates are no longer a separate scoring mode.
- **Unified generated runtime**: macro-generated solving builds one runtime
  model for scalar and list variables together, instead of maintaining separate
  standard/list solve shapes.
- **Exact retained telemetry**: retained status and events preserve generated,
  evaluated, and accepted move counts plus generation and evaluation
  `Duration`s through the solver pipeline. Human-facing `moves/s` remains a
  derived display metric only.

## Roadmap

```

**Why this design?**

1. **Zero-cost abstractions** — Rust's type system eliminates runtime overhead.
   Constraint streams compile to efficient machine code with no dynamic
   dispatch.

2. **Incremental scoring (SERIO)** — The Scoring Engine for Real-time
   Incremental Optimization only recalculates affected constraints when moves
   are evaluated, delivering 10-100x speedups.

3. **Type-safe moves** — `ChangeMove<S, V>` and `SwapMove<S, V>` store values
   inline without boxing or heap allocation. Arena allocation provides O(1)
   per-step cleanup.

4. **No garbage collection** — Predictable, low-latency performance without GC
   pauses.

5. **Modular architecture** — Each crate has a single responsibility, making the
   codebase maintainable and testable.

**The result:** You write declarative constraint logic that compiles to highly
optimized native code.
