SolverForge is a community-driven initiative to continue and expand upon the work started by Timefold's now-discontinued Python solver.

We aim to provide a first-class, open-source AI constraint solver for Python that is able to provide optimal solutions to problems such as Vehicle Routing, Employee Rostering, Maintenance Scheduling and more.

We’re picking up where Timefold left off, ensuring no loss in momentum for Python users: our legacy solver is a 1:1 fork of version 1.24.0b0 of the original Python solver.

Running `pip install solverforge-legacy` and updating your imports is all you need to get on board and continue receiving support.
